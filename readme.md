# Jobulizer 

Jobulizer is an interactive Jupyter Notebook project to help analyze and visualize a job search. 

## Getting started

To use Jobulizer, clone this git repo and add your data in CSV format to the `n` folder. Then, update the target file at the beginning of the notebook! Now you're ready to Jobulize your job search.


### Editing the schema

Seems like a useful extensibility of Jobulizer, right? This feature is TBD (to be decided, to be developed, etc).
