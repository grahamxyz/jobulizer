# Jobulizer 

Jobulizer is an interactive Jupyter Notebook project to help analyze and visualize a job search. 

## Getting started

To use Jobulizer, clone this git repo and add your data in CSV format to the `src` folder. Then, update `srcCsv` in the notebook to your csv file.

For example:

```python
srcCsv = "src/jobulizer-TEST.csv"
```

### Editing the schema

Seems like a useful extensibility of Jobulizer, right? This feature is TBD (to be decided, to be developed, etc).
